  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request
  # By default, a workflow only runs when a pull_request event's activity type is opened, synchronize, or reopened.
  # We want to run on 'closed' to trigger, but we also have to check if it was merged.
  # That check is: if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
